							<b>“Unleash your creativity with Chem-E-Car”.</b> The Chem-E-Car competition, organized by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), challenges students majoring in Chemical Engineering to design and construct small-scale automobiles powered by chemical energy sources. These cars are built to run a specific distance and stop safely. Participants must adhere to operating their cars using "green" methods, ensuring no visible pollution or waste in the form of liquid or gas is released, such as exhaust. Participants are evaluated on the basis of poster design, drive system creativity, vehicle design, performance, safety application, consistency, and team spirit.

							In the pursuit of greatness, competition fuels our fire. It beckons us to rise above, to unleash our full potential. A monopoly renders people complacent and satisfied with mediocrity. The Chem-E-Jeopardy is modeled on the well-known game Jeopardy, and the primary goal of the competition is to gauge and heighten participants' interest in the field of chemical engineering. In this case, the Gameboard includes hints related to both chemical engineerings as well as general domains. The participant must respond to the hint in the form of a question.
